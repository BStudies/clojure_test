* Closure utilizes Prefix Operation Notation. 
    Regular: 2+3
    Prefix: + 2 3
* Prefix is a bit easier on the computer in terms of the order of operations.

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.

## Examples
* Output to console
    ```
    (println {ANY VARIABLE OR LITERAL})
    ```

* String Methods
    ```
    (.split {STRING TO SPLIT} {WHAT TO SPLIT ON}))
    ```
    * Returns a vector from a string

* Vector Methods
    ```
    (map 
        (fn [x] 
            (.toUpperCase x)
        )
    {ORIGINAL VECTOR})
    ```

* Importing modules
    ```
    (require '[clojure.repl :refer :all])
    ```

* Defining functions
    * All of these are equivlent
        ```
        (defn greet [] println "Hello")
        (def greet (fn [] (println "Hello")))
        (def greet #(println "Hello"))
        ```


* Defining functions with different argument lengths
    ```
    (defn greeting 
        ([] (str "Hello, World")) 
        ([x] (str "Hello, " x "!")) 
        ([x y] (str x", "y"!"))
    )
    ```

* Testing 
    (assert (= "Hello, World" (greeting)))


* Using java (not javascript)
    * from java.lang.Math
        ```
        (= -1.0 (Math/cos Math/PI))
        ```

### Bugs

From the three days working on this it seems as though Clojure has problems implementing basic functionality such as looping over a vector and executing code. Because clojure is a functional language, it deals a lot with transformations easily. However if one needs to do looping and using indexing it seems to be far more complicated than it needs to be. 

We were also unable to find a good resource for documentation. Sure the examples provided by closure documentation show extreemly specific solutions to extreemly specific problems. It does not seem to be very applicable to simple tasks that one needs in a language. 

The error messages are not very helpful and are verbose. When googling the error message, discussions of seemily unrelated complex topics pop up which does not seem beneficial. One way around this is to user assertions however then the problems can get moved to a complex exception.

I am sure closure has great niche applications however I believe the complexity of the code is unnecessary.
