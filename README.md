# Clojure

## What is Clojure?

## Hello world
This is a simple hello world programm.
`(defn hello-world "This is a simple hello world function that takes no parameters"
  [] 
  (println (str "Hello " "World")))`
## Data types
1. Integers - In clojure, Integers consist of Whole numbers. ex: 1 2 3 4.
2. Boolean - Just like in other languages, Booleans are just True and False.
3. Char - This type represents a sigle character. ex: a b c
4. String - This type represents a chain of characters. ex: "Hell World"
5. Nil - This defines a non-exitent value such as NULL in other programming languages.
6. Atom - This type is used for concurrent programming. They can only be modified by special functions that check that if its value was altered.
7. Floating Point - These differ from integers in that they can hold decimal values. ex: 1.2 3.5
## Operators
1. '+' (plus) - Adds multiple numbers.

```;: will evaluate to 3
(+ 1 2 )
;; will evaluate to 6
(+ 1 2 3)```

2. '-' (minus) - Subtract  multiple numbers.
```;: will evaluate to -1
(- 1 2 )
;; will evaluate to 5
(- 10 2 3)```

3. '*' (multiplication) - Multiplies multiple numbers.
````;: will evaluate to 4
(* 2 2 )
;; will evaluate to 60
(* 10 2 3)```

4. '/' (division) - Divides multiple numbers.
```;: will evaluate to 5
(/ 10 2 )
;; will evaluate to 1
(- 10 2 5)```

5. inc - Increase a value by one.
```;; Evaluate to 2
(inc 1)```

6. dec - Decrease a value by one.
```;; Evaluate to 0
(dec 1)```

7. max - return the largest value of the numbers passed in.
```;;returns 3
(max 1 2 3)```

7. min - return the smallest value of the numbers passed in.
```;;returns 1
(min 100 22 39)```

9. rem - evaluates to the remainder of diving multiple numbers
```;;evaluates to 1
(rem 11 10)```
